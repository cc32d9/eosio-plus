# EOSIO+ Software Development Subgroup Objectives
- [ ] A set of standards and organizational processes to integrate code from outside developers.
- [ ] A description of the method to determine how various demands for new code development will be prioritized and implemented.
- [ ] A description of the process for performing ongoing release of new code and code binaries.
- [ ] Decide if we should also merge in #10 **Security Subgroup**

## Standards and Organizational Processes to Integrate Code from Outside Developers
- Should we consider the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Model of Contributors and Committers?
- Other popular open-source models we should consider?
- Brainstorm ideas

## Process to Prioritize Demands for New Code Development
- Should we consider the blue paper work as different than post blue paper - or are they the same?
  - Ted review process he plans for larger group on Thu?
    - Blue papers broken into SOWs (there are 7 in Audit+)
    - SOWs prioritized by vote - some SOWs are "killed" (not agreed work needs to be done by group)
    - Authors of top prioritized SOWs make initial cost/time estimate
    - If Author estimate accepted they begin developing
    - If Author estimate rejected, SOW placed out for RFP
    - Winner of RFP begins development
- Voting?  Who gets to vote?
- Voting weighted by contribution of chain?
- Other voting proposals?

## Ongoing Release of New Code and Binaries Process
- Should this also include CI/CD?
- Should we consider an integration enviroment hosted by this group?
